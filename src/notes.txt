promises in JS:
JSON=J S object notation
useEffect(() => {
        console.log("count=", count);
        fetch("https://randomuser.me/api/?results=10")//used to call API
      .then((response) => response.json())//this line converts the response obj(which API returns) into json data
      .then((data) => {
        const fetchedNames = data.results.map(
          (user) => `${user.name.first} ${user.name.last}`
        );
        setNames(fetchedNames);
    }
    
      )
    }, [count])


    to run a code after a certain delay we have setTimeout() but now what if we want to run a piece of code continously
    after a delay; 
    FOR THAT PURPOSE WE HAVE setInterval() !!!!!!! 
    we also need to clear the setInterval timer to stop it from running infinite time
